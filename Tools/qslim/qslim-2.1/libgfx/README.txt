OVERVIEW
--------

The purpose of this library is to simplify the creation of computer graphics
software.  Specifically, it is targeted towards cross-platform development
using the OpenGL rendering API and the FLTK interface toolkit.  It attempts to
provide facilities which are useful in the majority of graphics programs.  It
is derived from the MixKit library I wrote for doing polygonal surface
simplification (see http://www.uiuc.edu/~garland/software/qslim.html).

Instructions on building and using the library can be found in the 'doc'
subdirectory.



CURRENT STATUS
--------------

This is the second official release of the libgfx library.  After having
gone through multiple pre-release versions, the first official version
(1.0) was released in March 2002.  The changes made since that point
have been generally quite minor.  The code has been cleaned up in spots,
and a couple of small compilation bugs have been fixed.

While the license for this library does not require it, I'd like to
encourage you to contribute bug reports, patches, and whatever
improvements you might come up with to this library.  In that way,
others can benefit from your efforts, and you can benefit from the
efforts of others.
