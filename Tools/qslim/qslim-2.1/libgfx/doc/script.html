<h2>Simple File Format Scripting</h2>

<p>The <tt>libgfx</tt> library provides a very simple scripting facility which
is primarily intended to support parsing of input files and control scripts.
To use this package, you must include the header file:
<pre>
    #include &lt;gfx/script.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>For more information about this package, you may want to examine the
sample <a href="ex-script.html">scripted application</a>.

<h3>File Structure</h3>

<p>Scripts processed by this package are assumed to be composed of a sequence
of lines.  Each line is processed separately, in sequence, and falls into one
of the following categories:
<ol>
<li>Lines containing only whitespace are ignored
<li>Lines whose first non-whitespace character is a '#' (hash mark) are
treated as comments and are ignored
<li>All other lines are assumed to be a sequence of whitespace-separated
tokens where the first token is a command name and subsequent tokens are
arguments to this command.
</ol>

<h3>Processing Scripts</h3>

<p>In order to process scripts, you must (at minimum) perform the following
steps:
<ol>
<li>Instantiate a <i>scripting environment</i> of type <tt>CmdEnv</tt>.
<li>Register your command(s) with <tt>CmdEnv::register_command()</tt>
or <tt>CmdEnv::register_method()</tt>.
<li>Feed the text of the script to the parsing system.
</ol>
The specifics of these steps are detailed in the following sections.

<h4>The Scripting Environment</h4>

<p>The primary task of the scripting system is to map command name tokens into
command procedures.  These procedures, also referred to as "handlers", are
responsible for actually performing the computation associated with a
particular command.
Handlers should conform to the following type definition:
<pre>
    typedef int (*CmdHandler)(const CmdLine &amp;cmd);
</pre>
The <tt>CmdLine</tt> type manages the text of a particular command line, and
provides various methods for parsing that information (see details below).

<p>The <tt>CmdEnv</tt> class manages the mapping of command names to
handlers.  In particular, handler names are mapped to pointers to
objects derived from the base class <tt>CmdObject</tt>.  All derived
classes of <tt>CmdObject</tt> are required to override the
<tt>operator()</tt> invocation virtual method.  By using this virtual
function, handler objects are allowed to encapsulate arbitrary data in
their definition (i.e., to create closures).  The standard scripting
framework defines two kinds of <tt>CmdObject</tt> handlers: (1) the
<tt>CmdFunction</tt> class to encapsulate normal functions and static
methods and (2) and the <tt>CmdMethod</tt> template class to
encapsulate member functions.


<p>New handler procedures (non-member functions)
can be associated with names using
the method:
<pre>
    void register_command(const std::string&amp; name, CmdHandler proc);
</pre>
Member functions can be bound to names uses the templated member
function:
<pre>
    template&lt;class T&gt;
    void register_method(const std::string& name,
                         T *obj,
                         int (T::*fn)(const CmdLine&));
</pre>
Note that in both cases, prior bindings of <tt>name</tt> associated
with another handler will be overwritten.
Existing handlers can be located by name
using the method:
<pre>
    CmdObject *lookup_command(const std::string&amp; name);
</pre>
which returns <tt>NULL</tt> if no handler is bound to the given name.

<h4>Submitting Text for Execution</h4>

<p>Several procedures are available for submitting script text to the parsing
system.  All of them require a <tt>CmdEnv</tt> argument that will determine
the mapping of command names to handlers.

<p>The underlying method for parsing text is:
<pre>
    int script_do_line(std::string &amp;line, CmdEnv &amp;env);
    int script_do_line(const char *line, CmdEnv &amp;env);
</pre>
It assumes that its input is a string consisting of a single line &mdash; any
embedded newlines will be treated like any other whitespace.
It will
split this line it a series of whitespace-separated tokens, interpreting the
first such token as a command name.  If <tt>env</tt> provides a binding for
this name, the appropriate handler will be called.

<p>For convenience, the scripting package also provides the following methods:
<pre>
    int script_do_stream(std::istream &amp;in, CmdEnv &amp;env);
    int script_do_file(const char *name, CmdEnv &amp;env);
    int script_do_string(const char *str, CmdEnv &amp;env);
</pre>
They operate by extracting a single line from the input source and processing
that line with <tt>script_do_line()</tt>.  They repeat this line-by-line
process until the file/stream/string has been exhausted.
The first time the processing of a line fails with an error code, these
procedures return this error code immediately without completing the
processing of the rest of the input.


<h3>Writing Command Handlers</h3>

<p>A command procedure is declared as follows:
<pre>
    int proc(const CmdLine&amp; cmd);
</pre>
The <tt>CmdLine</tt> structure contains all the necessary data about the line
being processed.  It provides the following fundamental accessors:
<pre>
    class CmdLine
    {
    public:
	const std::string &amp;line;        // Raw text of the (complete) line
	std::string opname() const;     // Name of the command being invoked
	std::string argline() const;    // Argument string
	int argcount() const;           // Number of argument tokens
    };
</pre>
The argument string returned by <tt>argline()</tt> is unparsed except that
whitespace following the command name and trailing whitespace at the end of
the line have been removed.


<p>It is up to the handler to parse the command line in whatever way it likes.
However, the scripting system assumes that command will be given
whitespace-separated token lists.  Therefore, it pre-computes the indices of
these tokens in the command line text before invoking the handler.  To access
an individual token, you can use the <tt>CmdLine</tt> methods:
<pre>
    std::string token_to_string(int i) const;
    double token_to_double(int i) const;
    float token_to_float(int i) const;
    int token_to_int(int i) const;
</pre>
Tokens are numbered from <tt>[0 .. argcount()-1]</tt>.  Note that, for
efficiency, these methods <em>do not perform range checking.</em>  It is up to
the caller to verify that the given indices are valid.

<p>In addition to accessing single argument tokens, you can collect all
argument tokens into lists with the following <tt>CmdLine</tt> methods:
<pre>
    int collect_as_strings(std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; &amp;v) const;
    int collect_as_numbers(std::vector&lt;double&gt; &amp;v) const;
    int collect_as_numbers(std::vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;v) const;

    int collect_as_numbers(double *v, int size) const;
    int collect_as_numbers(float *v, int size) const;
    int collect_as_numbers(int *v, int size) const;
</pre>
These methods always return the number of tokens collected.
The <tt>vector</tt>-based methods will always collect all available tokens.
In contrast, those which accept raw arrays will either collect <tt>size</tt>
or <tt>argcount()</tt> tokens, whichever is smaller.

details on how to write command handlers.
