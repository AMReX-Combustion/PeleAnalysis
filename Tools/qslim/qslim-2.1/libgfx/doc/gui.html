<h2>Minimalist GUI Framework</h2>

<p>All interactive graphics applications need to create some sort of graphical
user interface.  While many applications may require a fairly sophisticated
interface, there is a large class of applications which can be built with a
very simple interface.  The <tt>libgfx</tt> library provides a framework to
ease the construction of such simple interfaces.

<p>The kind of application interface supported by the GUI framework is
pictured in the following figure:
<blockquote>
<center><img src="gui-layout.gif"></center>
</blockquote>

The application window consists of three primary components:
<ol>
<li>A menu bar, which is managed by the GUI framework,
<li>An OpenGL canvas window where the application is free to draw its content
and receive user events such as mouse clicks, and
<li>A status bar where the application can print text messages.
</ol>

<p>The <a href="ex-gui.html">code for the application pictured
above</a> provides a concrete example of using this GUI framework.

<h3>Creating a GUI Application</h3>

<p>To begin building your GUI application, you'll need to include the GUI
framework header:
<pre>
    #include &lt;gfx/gui.h&gt;
</pre>
The framework itself is packaged as a C++ class named <tt>MxGUI</tt>.
You create your application by subclassing it and overriding various virtual
methods.  You can then create a single instance of this class, which will
represent your application.
For consistency, it is recommended that you name
the derived subclass <tt>GUI</tt> and its instance <tt>gui</tt> as in the
following:
<pre>
    class GUI : public MxGUI
    {
    public:
        <i>// Application variables and methods</i>

    public:
	<i>// Override virtual methods to handle events</i>
    };

    GUI gui; <i>// Create application instance</i>
</pre>

<p>Programs based using this framework always use the <tt>main()</tt>
procedure as their entry point, <em>even on Windows systems</em>.
Inside this main procedure, you should perform this general sequence of
operations:
<ol>
<li>Initialize global variables and member variables defined in the
<tt>GUI</tt> class.
<li>Call the <tt>gui.initialize()</tt> procedure to parse the command line and
create the application.
<li>Customize the default application by changing labels, adding menus, etc.
<li>Call <tt>gui.run()</tt> to open the application window and begin the event
loop.
</ol>

<p>The <tt>MxGUI::initialize</tt> method must be called to initialize the GUI
framework.
<pre>
    virtual void initialize(int argc, char **argv,
			    Fl_Menu_Item *layout=NULL, int xw=640, int yw=480);
</pre>
You should pass to it the <tt>argc</tt> and <tt>argv</tt> command-line
variables as passed into <tt>main()</tt>.  The framework will take care of
parsing the command-line and calling the appropriate handlers.
The optional <tt>layout</tt> argument can be used to specify an initial menu
structure; the default value of <tt>NULL</tt> directs the framework to use the
default menu layout.
The optional <tt>xw</tt> and <tt>yw</tt> arguments specify the desired width
and height (in pixels) of the OpenGL canvas.

<h4>Command-Line Processing</h4>

<p>
The <tt>MxGUI</tt> framework uses the FLTK
<a href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.0/functions.html#args"><tt>Fl::args</tt></a>
facility to parse the command line passed to <tt>MxGUI::initialize()</tt>.
For each option on the command line, it invokes the following handler:
<pre>
    virtual int cmdline_option(int argc, char **argv, int& index);
</pre>
The <tt>argc</tt> and <tt>argv</tt> values are the complete array originally
passed to <tt>initialize()</tt>.  The <tt>index</tt> argument indicates which
element of <tt>argv</tt> contains the current switch being processed.
This <tt>index</tt> variable is passed by reference to allow the handler to
consume additional elements of <tt>argv</tt> by incrementing <tt>index</tt>.
The handler should return <tt>1</tt> if it handled the switch and <tt>0</tt>
otherwise.

<p>Once all options have been processed, the initialization code invokes the
following handler for each file listed on the command line.
<pre>
    virtual void cmdline_file(const char *file);
</pre>
If no files are specified this handler will be invoked with a <tt>NULL</tt>
value.

<h4>Drawing</h4>

<p>The <tt>MxGUI</tt> framework uses two virtual methods to control drawing in
the OpenGL canvas.  The first of these is:
<pre>
    virtual void setup_for_drawing();
</pre>
This method is called whenever the canvas has been reconfigured.  Primarily,
this occurs when the canvas has either just been shown on the screen (e.g.,
after creation) or when it has been resized.

<p>Whenever the canvas needs to be repainted, the framework will invoke the
handler:
<pre>
    virtual void draw_contents();
</pre>
You should override this method and place all your drawing code in it.


<h4>Handling Mouse Events</h4>

<p>Interactive applications will typically want to receive mouse events taking
place on the OpenGL canvas.  The framework classifies mouse events into three
types:
<ol>
<li><strong>Button down:</strong>
	the user has depressed a mouse button
<li><strong>Button up:</strong>
	the user has released a previously depressed button
<li><strong>Drag:</strong>
	the user is moving the mouse with a button depressed
</ol>
When one of these events occur, the corresponding event handler will be
invoked:
<pre>
    virtual bool mouse_down(int *where, int which);
    virtual bool mouse_up(int *where, int which);
    virtual bool mouse_drag(int *where, int *last, int which);
</pre>
The <tt>where</tt> argument is a 2-D array containing the pixel location in
the OpenGL canvas at which the mouse was pointing when the event occurred.
The number of the button involved (either 1, 2, or 3) is passed in the
<tt>which</tt> argument.
To simplify drag operations, that event handler is also passed the location of
the <tt>last</tt> received drag event.

<p>All of these mouse handlers should return <tt>true</tt> if the canvas
should be redrawn in response to the event just handled.  If the canvas does
not need to be updated, they should return <tt>false</tt>.

<h4>Handling Key Presses</h4>

<p>Key press events can be received through the virtual function:
<pre>
    virtual bool key_press(int key);
</pre>
The return value of this function indicates whether the key press event
was consumed by the handler.  You should make sure to return
<tt>false</tt> if you do not use the given key, otherwise keyboard
accelerators for the menu bar will no longer function correctly.

<p>Note that FLTK defines
<a
    href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.0/enumerations.html#key_values">symbolic
    names</a> for non-ASCII keys.  You can also query the state of the
modifier keys using the <tt><a href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.0/enumerations.html#13_6">Fl::event_state()</a></tt> function.

<h4>Animation</h4>

<p>A very simple mechanism for supporting animation is also provided by the
framework.  To take advantage of this, first set the <tt>MxGUI</tt> instance
variable
<pre>
    float default_fps;
</pre>
to the desired number of frames per second (defaults to 24).  The method
<pre>
    void animate(bool will);
</pre>
can then be used to start and stop animation.
The system works by setting a system timer to go off every 1/fps of a second.
When that timer goes off, the framework will call the handler
<pre>
    virtual void update_animation();
</pre>
so that the application can update its state appropriately, after which the
framework will invoke the <tt>draw_contents()</tt> handler to repaint the
canvas.  Note that this system makes no effort to guarantee a consistent
update rate.

<p>The default menu bar contains items to toggle animation on and off and to
set the desired <tt>default_fps</tt> value.


<h3>The Menu Bar</h3>

<p>Many GUI applications use menu systems to provide the user control over the
application.  By default, the <tt>MxGUI</tt> framework creates a very simple
menu layout for its applications.  This standard menu provides basic features
such as saving a snapshot of the OpenGL canvas to an image file, toggling
animation, and setting the size of the display canvas.
However, the application also has complete freedom to customize the menu
system.

<h4>Static Menu Layouts</h4>

<p>The <tt>initialize()</tt> method accepts an optional argument which
specifies the layout of the menu system.  This layout is an array of <a
href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.0/Fl_Menu_Item.html">Fl_Menu_Item</a> elements,
whose format is described in the <a
href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.0/Fl_Menu_Item.html">FLTK documentation</a>.
Passing a menu layout to <tt>initialize()</tt> will completely replace the
default menu structure.

<h4>Adding Menus at Run Time</h4>

<p>Once an initial menu system has been created, either the default or an
application-specific one, additional items can be added at run time.  To do
this, you can invoke the <a
href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.0/Fl_Menu_.html#Fl_Menu_.add"><tt>add()</tt></a>
method of the <tt>MxGUI::menu_bar</tt> object.


<h3>The Status Bar</h3>

<p>The status bar at the bottom of the GUI application can be used to display
short textual messages to the user.
You can use the following method to print text in the status bar:
<pre>
    int status(const char *fmt, ...);
</pre>
It accepts argument lists of exactly the same form as the <tt>printf</tt>
function of the C standard library.
