<h2>Interactive Rotation Control</h2>

<p>The <tt>libgfx</tt> library provides a fairly simple facility for
interactive inspection of 3-D objects.  The interface is designed
for applications where a user is inspecting an object by spinning it and
by translating the camera to provide a better view.  All of the user
interaction is implemented through mouse motion:
<ul>
    <li>Left mouse drag &mdash; rotate object about its centroid
    <li>Right mouse drag &mdash; translate camera forward/backward
    <li>Middle mouse drag &mdash; translate camera parallel to image plane
</ul>

<p>The classes used to implement this functionality are based on a
fairly standard paradigm.  Two subsequent mouse positions are projected
onto a notional surface "below" the window.  The cross product of these
projected vectors defines an axis of rotation and the angle between them
defines the rotation angle.

<h3>Ball Types</h3>

<p>The library currently supports two control classes:

<blockquote>

<p><b>Arcball</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcball controller is based on the
article <i>Arcball Rotation Control</i> written by Ken Shoemake in
<i>Graphics Gems IV</i> published by Academic Press.
The underlying surface of projection is a hemisphere.

<p><b>Trackball</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implements the mechanism used in the SGI
3-D demo programs.  This approach was originally developed by Gavin
Bell.  The underlying surface of projection is a hybrid of a hemisphere
and a hyperbolic sheet.
</blockquote>

<h3>Public Interface</h3>

<p>The two controller types both implement the same public interface,
and can be freely interchanged in the application program.  The
interfaces for these controllers are defined in the following header
files:
<ul>
    <li><tt>class Arcball</tt> &mdash; <tt>&lt;gfx/arcball.h&gt;</tt>
    <li><tt>class Trackball</tt> &mdash; <tt>&lt;gfx/trackball.h&gt;</tt>
</ul>
To use one of the controllers, you need to include the appropriate
header and create an instance of the appropriate class.

<h4>Initialization</h4>

<p>Before using a rotation controller, you must initialize it by
providing the bounding sphere of the object to be controlled.  This is
done using the templated method:
<pre>
    template&lt;class T&gt;
    void bounding_sphere(const TVec3&lt;T&gt;&amp; center, T radius);
</pre>
The specified sphere <tt>center</tt> will be the point about which the
object will rotate.

<h4>Interaction</h4>

<p>Once initialized, the controller is meant to be interfaced directly
with the event handlers of an application built using the
<tt>libgfx</tt> <a href="gui.html">GUI framework</a>.
Each of the following controller methods should be called from the event
handlers of your application.
<pre>
    virtual void update_animation();
    virtual bool mouse_down(int *where, int which);
    virtual bool mouse_up(int *where, int which);
    virtual bool mouse_drag(int *where, int *last, int which);
</pre>

<h4>Applying Results</h4>

<p>For the rotation to take effect, you must apply it in the rendering
loop of the application.  Before drawing your scene, you should call the
method:
<pre>
    virtual void apply_transform();
</pre>
This will set up the appropriate transform on the <tt>ModelView</tt>
matrix stack.  Similarly, when done drawing, you should call the method:
<pre>
    virtual void unapply_transform();
</pre>
which will clean up the <tt>ModelView</tt> matrix stack.
