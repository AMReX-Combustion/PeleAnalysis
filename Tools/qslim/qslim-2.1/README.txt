OVERVIEW
--------

This is the SlimKit collection of surface modeling tools.  Most of the
programs in this collection simply provide an interface to the
underlying functionality of the MixKit library (see mixkit/README.txt).

The primary component of this package is the QSlim 2.1 surface
simplification tool located in the tools/qslim directory.  Please
consult tools/qslim/QSlim.txt for further information.  There are also
several useful programs in tools/filters/ for manipulating SMF model
files.

New in this release is the QCluster software package in tools/cluster.


BUILDING & INSTALLATION
-----------------------

To build on a Unix machine:

	(1) cd libgfx
	(2) ./configure
	(3) cd src; make
	(4) cd ../../mixkit
	(5) ./configure
	(6) cd src; make
	(7) cd ../../tools/qslim
	(8) make all

I have tested this process on both Linux (Debian) and Mac OS X (10.3)
machines.  Compilation on other Unix platforms should probably work as
well.

I no longer use Windows on a regular basis, and have not updated the
Windows build files.  The Unix directions given above should work
correctly with Cygwin.  Some slightly out-of-date project files for
compiling under MS Visual C++ 6.0 can be found in SlimKit workspace in
the "win32" directory.  You can probably get them working without too
much effort.

Finally:

FUTURE PLANS
------------

None.  This software package has changed relatively little since its
initial public release in March 1999.  The only substantial changes were
switching to an FLTK-based GUI and repackaging some of the common code
in the new libgfx library.  I ceased active development on the
simplification-related MixKit code several years ago.  At this point, I
do not have plans for any further releases of this software.
