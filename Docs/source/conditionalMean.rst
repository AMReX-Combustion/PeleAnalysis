conditionalMean - Create data for conditional mean plots
********************************************************

Given a plotfile, a conditioning variable, and a list of variables, create data files, each containing
conditional means and standard deviations in each of a set of bins of the conditioning variable.
Use `plotJpdf.m` from the `Scripts` folder to plot the resulting data in matlab/octave, using a line for the
mean, and a gray shaded region for the values within a standard-deviation of the mean.
