streamSub - Subset streamlines
******************************

Extract a subset of streamlines from a streamline file, based on one
of a set of user-selectable criteria (random sampling, physical
location of the streamline seed point, etc). This process will discard
the connectivity info of the streamlines.  Typically, this tool is used
to extract a manageable number of lines for quick plotting in order to
get a feel, or gather statistics, for the data contained in the full
set.
