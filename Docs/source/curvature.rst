curvature - Curvature of plotfile scalar
****************************************

Given a plotfile that contains a scalar quantity, compute the local value of the mean and Gaussian
curvature of isopleths of that scalar at all cells in the solution.  Either create a new plotfile
containing only these computed quantities, or append the fields to the existing plotfile.
