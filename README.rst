PeleAnalysis
============

A collection of standalone routines for processing AMReX plotfiles.

Contributions
-------------

To add a new feature to PeleAnalysis, the procedure is:

1. Create a branch for the new feature (locally) ::

    git checkout -b AmazingNewFeature

2. Develop the feature, merging changes often from the development branch into your AmazingNewFeature branch ::
   
    git commit -m "Developed AmazingNewFeature"
    git checkout development
    git pull                     [fix any identified conflicts between local and remote branches of "development"]
    git checkout AmazingNewFeature
    git merge development        [fix any identified conflicts between "development" and "AmazingNewFeature"]

3. Push feature branch to PeleAnalysis repository (if you have write access, otherwise fork the repo and
push the new branch to your fork)::

    git push -u origin AmazingNewFeature [Note: -u option required only for the first push of new branch]

4.  Submit a merge request through the github project page - be sure you are requesting to merge your branch to the development branch.
